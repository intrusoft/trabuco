Node failure/remove from cluster is not currently handled
- add minimal overhead health check that can instanatly get concensus on bad node, then remove from lists
- propogate removal of node from all nodes list
- preserving the data from the bad node would take some sort data replica scheme

Because things are UDP and not acknowleged, the mechanisms are best effort, but non-blocking
It's possible to overwhelm node by sending too many requests at once
Distribution doesn't seem implement 100%, there is some uneven keyspace usage
Add versioning to deal with replica and race condition conflict resolution

Intentionally not adding threading, which by default provides some node level atomicity
