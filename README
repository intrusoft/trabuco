 Naive implementation of DHT over a UDP overlay network

 This was just code I wrote for fun and learn more about the concepts of DHT

 To use this:

 Start this trabuco.py process on several nodes (or the same node, but different ports)
 python trabuco.py --localip 127.0.0.1 --localport 10001 (first node)
 python trabuco.py --localip 127.0.0.1 --localport 10002 --peerip 127.0.0.1 --peerport 10001  
 (for each additional node, where localIP:localport are unique)

 Peerip and peerport just need to point to another node already running trabuco, 
 once connected, it will get a list of all the other peers can can connect directly to them

 Use the query.py script to GET and SET keys/values
 ./query.py --key foo --value bar
